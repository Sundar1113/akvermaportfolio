    My name is <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold">Abhinav Kumar Verma</span>, age 27, exploring the frontiers of
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Complex Adaptive Systems, Network Sciences, and AI</span>. I focus on developing
      advanced AGI systems by leveraging technologies like deep learning and large language models, integrating them with the latest developments in 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> complex sciences, network dynamics, information theory, and cognitive science</span>.
      <br /><br />
      I completed my Matriculation (Class 10th) and Intermediate (Class 12th) from the CBSE board at 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Delhi Public School, Varanasi</span>. During school, I participated in multiple prestigious Olympiads 
      and qualified <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> INMO</span> and <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> KVPY</span>. I joined the 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur</span> in 2014, 
      where I was rigorously trained in subjects such as linear algebra, probability, algorithms, information theory, and statistical signal processing. 
      I consistently performed well, improving my SGPA from 8.36 to 9.71 in my final semester, demonstrating resilience and determination. 
      For my M.Tech thesis, I developed an end-to-end physical layer simulator of WiFi in MATLAB under the expert guidance of 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Prof. Suvra Sekhar Das</span>.
      <br /><br />
      During college, I participated in multiple hackathons, business pitches, product design competitions, and robotics challenges, winning accolades 
      in circuit design, game theory, and robotics. I interned at prestigious institutions such as 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Team Indus (a space agency)</span> and <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Laval University</span>, 
      gaining experience in domains ranging from space technologies to quantum computing and ASIC design. With these skills, I can design, prototype, 
      and produce hardware systems. In my final two years, I specialized in <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold">Telecommunication System Engineering</span>, 
      gaining expertise in advanced wireless communication subjects such as MIMO communication, OFDM, and signal processing.
      <br /><br />
      After college, I joined the modem systems team at <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold">Qualcomm, Hyderabad</span>, where I designed multiple 
      system protocols and simulators for cutting-edge cellular technologies. I took initiatives to automate processes, conserving man-hours, 
      and integrated systems to predict power consumption in upcoming chips, providing a competitive edge in a constrained timeframe. 
      Additionally, I worked on designing a high-speed inter-chip communication protocol and simulator for efficient data transfer between radio 
      and modem units. At Qualcomm, I collaborated with a global team, learning the importance of teamwork, coordination, and leadership.
      <br /><br />

        "What is intelligence? Is my smartphone or a dolphin more intelligent than my tennis racquet? What about the collective intelligence of 
        humanity, the internet, and individual curiosity? Can intelligence be quantified, studied, or modeled?"
      </span> â€“ These questions led me to explore <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold">Complex Science</span>. While working, I delved into 
      network science, random graph theory, non-linear dynamics, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, AI/ML, GNNs, and LLMs. I resigned from Qualcomm in 
      July 2023 to dedicate myself to self-study and independent research. Since then, I have worked on four projects in these domains and have 
      a research paper on <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold">edge-critical directed graphs</span> in the submission pipeline. My research spans 
      LLMs, network science, random graph theory, and cellular automata, reflecting my deep interest in these fields.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, I am actively looking for a doctoral position in the closely interdependent domains of 
      <span className="text-teal-500 font-bold"> Network Science, Complex Systems, Brain Networks, and Graph Neural Networks</span>. 
      With my academic background, industry experience, and research expertise, I am eager to contribute to and explore groundbreaking advancements in these fields.
